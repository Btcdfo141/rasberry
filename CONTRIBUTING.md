# Contributing to Home Assistant

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Home Assistant. There is a lot to do...if you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on [home-assistant.io](https://home-assistant.io/)? If you are a developer and have devices in your home which aren't working with Home Assistant yet, why not spent a couple of hours and help to integrate them? 

## Getting Started
The process is straight-forward.
 - Fork the Home Assistant [git repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant).
 - Write the code for your device, notification service, sensor, or IoT thing.
 - Ensure tests work.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/tree/dev) branch of Home Assistant.

Still interested? Then you should take a peak at the [developer documentation](https://home-assistant.io/developers/) to get more details.

## Submitting Issues
1. Feature requests and enhancements are not issues. Feature should be requested on the [community forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/).
2. Make sure you are running the latest version of Home Assistant.
3. Make sure there is not currently an issue submitted that matches yours.
4. Fill out the Issue submission form as completely as possible.
5. It may take some time to get a response. All developers are volunteers and have real world responsibilities.

## Submitting Pull Requests
1. Fill out the Pull Request submission form as completely as possible.
2. Make sure you complete all required tasks in the checklist.
3. Make sure you are working on a clean branch.
