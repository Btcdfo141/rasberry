# Using a locally set up mypy instead of the "real" mypy hook, because
# mypy's results depend on what is installed. The "real" one runs in a
# virtualenv of its own, meaning we'd need to install and maintain
# another set of our dependencies there... no. Use a wrapper script
# that launches the one installed in the currently active environment
# that is set up as desired instead.
