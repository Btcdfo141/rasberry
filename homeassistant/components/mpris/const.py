# Remove additional instances of media players as they exit.
# By default false, if enabled, this option ensures that
# Home Assistant automatically removes media player instances
# beyond the first instance of a media player â€” when the
# media player supports multiple instances, such as VLC when
# its respective setting is turned on.
# In some use cases, this keeps the user experience nice,
# but it is not on by default because (we assume) most users
# would prefer to keep the history of what their extra players
# have played in the past, and removal of an entity usually
# removes the history of the entity (at least after a while).
