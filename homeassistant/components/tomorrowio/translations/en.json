Unfortunately, **the V3 API is now deprecated** and you will need to get a new V4 API key from [Tomorrow.io](https://app.tomorrow.io/development/keys) before we can complete the migration. Once you have obtained a new API key, enter it on the next screen and hit submit so it can be verified. Your old ClimaCell config entry will then be automatically removed and replaced by a Tomorrow.io one."
